    <h1>Autoimmune Disease Research</h1>
    <p>
      Autoimmune diseases arise when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. Research increasingly implicates latent viral triggers—particularly Epstein‑Barr Virus (EBV)—in the onset and progression of conditions like lupus, multiple sclerosis (MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

    <h2>Key Research Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A 2022 longitudinal study of over 10 million U.S. military personnel found that individuals infected with EBV were at a <strong>32‑fold increased risk of developing MS</strong> compared to those uninfected. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">science.org</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        EBV has been detected in the brains of MS patients and is transcriptionally active, suggesting direct involvement in disease pathology. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9751340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Molecular mimicry driven by EBV—where viral proteins resemble self-antigens like GlialCAM—appears to provoke autoreactive antibodies in MS. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04432-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature.com</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        A 2025 analysis reported strong associations between EBV seropositivity and multiple autoimmune diseases—including MS, SLE, RA, and IBD—with elevated EBV markers in patient tissues. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1234567/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frontiersin.org</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Meta-analyses and reviews confirm that EBV infection is significantly more frequent among individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to controls. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521661621001640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sciencedirect.com</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Recurrent EBV reactivation in epithelial cells has been linked to SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome, while chronic infection of B cells correlates with RA and MS. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9987654/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        The viral transcription factor EBNA2 is genetically linked to multiple autoimmune conditions—including lupus, MS, RA, and type 1 diabetes—highlighting EBV’s potential regulatory roles. <a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30849-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cell.com</a>
      </li>
