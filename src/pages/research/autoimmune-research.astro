    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Autoimmune diseases occur when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. Conditions like lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes have been linked to viral triggers, particularly from the herpesvirus family. Recent research increasingly ties Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) to a wide range of autoimmune disorders, suggesting these latent infections may play a role in immune system misfiring.

    <h2>Key Areas of Focus</h2>

    <h3>1. Epstein-Barr Virus and Autoimmune Disease</h3>
    <p>
      EBV, a common herpesvirus, has been linked to diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers believe molecular mimicry—where viral proteins resemble human proteins—may be a trigger.

    </ul>

    <h3>2. Autoimmune Disease Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>
      Autoimmunity may arise from genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and persistent infections. The role of gut permeability and microbiome imbalance is also under investigation.

    <h3>3. General Immune System Research</h3>
    <p>
      Studies highlight how a chronically activated immune system, even in low-grade inflammation, can cause long-term health issues and autoimmune reactivity.

    <h3>4. Proactive Immune System Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      Proactive approaches like supporting T-cell regulation, antiviral nutrition, and herbal immune modulators are being studied for potential preventative effects.
