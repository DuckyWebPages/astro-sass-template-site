      This page is not a complete collection of research, but it highlights select scientific studies explaining why we choose the natural products we do. While we use many approaches beyond Flax Hull Lignans to support health, this page focuses specifically on Flax Hull Lignan research. If any link is unavailable, email us at <strong>info@aidshivawareness.org</strong>—we maintain offline copies of all listed studies.

  <h2>ARAI Studies Results</h2>
  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>We are a non-profit organization.</strong> We are not scientists. We are hands-on, working with people who are sick and unwilling to wait for science to come up with an answer.</p>

    <p>We hosted 3 studies run by nurses. The purpose of the studies were to help us decide if the flax hull lignans really worked so that we could make a decision on whether or not to incorporate them into our programs. We were beyond surprised and impressed with the results.</p>

    <p><strong>Rounds 1 & 2:</strong> Participants used 2 scoops per day mixed in water, cereal, or foods and completed 30/60/90-day reports (no medication or lifestyle changes during that time). During Round 1, 15% experienced constipation from the fiber; they increased water or dropped to 1 scoop/day. <strong>76%</strong> reported some positive response within 30 days, <strong>91%</strong> within 90 days. Reported changes included tumor size reduction, improved blood sugar/insulin needs, decreased HIV/AIDS symptoms, better energy, and improved CD4/viral load trends. <strong>10%</strong> reported no change.</p>

    <p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Everyone used 1 scoop/day for 90 days. Results matched Round 1, with <strong>55%</strong> reporting positive response in the first 30 days, <strong>90%</strong> by 90 days, and <strong>0%</strong> constipation issues.</p>

    <p>Across Rounds 1 & 2, dramatic improvements seen in the first 30 days were generally maintained through 60 and 90 days; most changes that were going to occur in 90 days happened in the first 30.</p>

    <p><strong>Round 3 (Durban & Piet Retief, South Africa; Swaziland):</strong> 1 scoop/day for adults, ½ scoop/day for children ≤12. All 100 were HIV-positive; 75% had AIDS-related symptoms (e.g., cancer, thrush, fatigue, weakness, swollen glands). <strong>64%</strong> reported health changes within 30 days; <strong>97%</strong> by 90 days. The strong nutritional profile likely supported weight/height gains and recovery from multiple symptoms.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> After 3 rounds, we are confident flax hull lignans can support immune health as originally hoped.</p>

  <h2>HIV & AIDS Research & Testimonials</h2>
  <div class="testimonials">
    <div class="testimonial">
      <h3>Karen – AIDS, USA</h3>
      <p>
        When found in March 2004, Karen was bedridden in hospice care. Doctors had given up hope. 
        Within weeks of starting the flax lignan program, she was walking, unloading trucks, and 
        living independently. Her viral load dropped to non-detectable, she regained her strength, 
        and eventually got married with a new lease on life.

      <h3>Alan – HIV Positive, Georgia</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Before flax: Viral Load = 135,000, CD4 = 220</li>
        <li>After flax: Viral Load = Undetectable, CD4 = 470</li>
        <li>30 Days: More energy, better appetite</li>
        <li>60 Days: VL non-detectable, highest T-cell count</li>
        <li>90 Days: Still non-detectable</li>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>1. What are flax lignans?</dt>
    <dd>Lignans are phytonutrients in plants—flaxseed is the richest known source, with up to 800x more than other plants. They are known to boost immunity and have anti-cancer, anti-viral, and antioxidant effects.</dd>
    <dt>2. Can’t I just grind flax seeds?</dt>
    <dd>No. Ground flax seeds go rancid quickly and only offer a fraction of the benefit. The concentrated lignans we use are shelf-stable and provide the equivalent benefit of 70 teaspoons of flaxseed in just one teaspoon. (We recommend only using FlaxLignanHealth.com or North Dakota Innovations)</dd>
    <dt>3. What about flax oil with lignans?</dt>
    <dd>Flax oil contains almost no lignans and lacks digestive co-factors. It's useful for fatty acids but not lignan content.</dd>
    <dt>4. Does heat destroy lignans?</dt>
    <dd>Enzymes may be killed, but the immunity-boosting benefits remain. Great for baking.</dd>
    <dt>5. Are flax lignans safe?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, for most healthy individuals. Those with hormone-related conditions or pregnant/nursing women should consult a doctor.</dd>
    <dt>6. What other nutrients are in flax lignans?</dt>
    <dd>Each scoop (½ tbsp) contains 2.15g dietary fiber and 1.4g protein.</dd>
    <dt>7. Can someone with breast cancer take flax lignans?</dt>
    <dd>See our breast cancer research links above and consult your doctor. Many studies show potential benefits, but individual research is encouraged.</dd>
