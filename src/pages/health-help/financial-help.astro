    <h1>We Support Others</h1>
    <p>
      At ARAI, we are passionate about helping people facing serious health challenges.
      Our mission is to provide natural, research-based protocols to those in needâ€”
      especially when finances are a barrier.
    </p>

    <p>
      We maintain a waitlist for individuals who would like to try a health protocol but need partial
      financial support. If you're ready to commit to a protocol and can raise part of the cost, we may be able to help
      with the rest. We'll even provide you with a link to gather support from friends and family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Protocols typically last 12 weeks, and we ask that participants check in every two weeks and
      submit a final report at the end of the study period. Please fill out the form below to see how we can help you. If no funds are available, we may put you on a waiting list to help in the future. We do not guarantee that we will be able to help, but this alerts us that you are wanting assistance.
