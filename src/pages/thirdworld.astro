  <h2>Third World Help</h2>
  <p>
    We want to reach out to other non-profits, churches, and organizations who have people with immune system challenges or malnourished children. We have a waiting list and a certain amount of nutritionals we can donate every year. The best situation is when you have people visiting from the USAâ€”we can ship some to them so they can take it in suitcases to orphanages and communities around the world. The second option is direct shipping, but this is often expensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please reach out to us through the form below and provide details about your organization or the individuals needing support.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also send donation checks to: <strong>ARAI, 6868 Backcountry Loop, Colorado Springs, CO 80927</strong>.
