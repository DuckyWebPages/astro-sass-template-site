    <h1>Autoimmune Protocol</h1>

    <p>
      Autoimmune diseases are often triggered or exacerbated by latent viruses hiding in the body. A key area of concern is the <strong>dorsal root ganglia</strong>‚Äînerve bundles that run along both sides of the spine. Research has shown that certain viruses, including herpesviruses like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), can remain dormant in these nerve clusters for years, flaring during times of stress or immune suppression.

      <p>
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Scientific studies show that certain viruses‚Äîespecially those in the herpesvirus family‚Äîcan hide in <strong>dorsal root ganglia</strong>, which are nerve bundles located along both sides of the spine.

      </p>

      <p>
        Additional research supports that <strong>latent infections in the DRG</strong> can be reactivated by physiological stress or injury‚Äîmaking this region a key viral reservoir.

      <p>
        This evidence strengthens the theory behind the <strong>Raindrop Technique</strong>‚Äîa protocol that applies anti-viral essential oils along the spine‚Äîto support immune recovery and reduce latent viral activity.
      </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">The Raindrop Technique</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Raindrop Technique</strong> is a massage-like protocol that applies specific antiviral essential oils directly onto the spine, focusing on the nerve-rich areas along both sides. This technique may help suppress viral activity, allowing the immune system space to repair and restore itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many anecdotal (non-clinical) cases have shown that individuals with autoimmune disorders experience significant symptom improvement‚Äîor even reversal‚Äîwith consistent use of this method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The working theory is this: if viral activity is suppressed long enough, the body can begin to heal itself‚Äîlayer by layer.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Protocol Recommendation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Receive <strong>one Raindrop Technique per week</strong>‚Äîcontinue for as long as symptom reversal is observed.</li>
      <li>This protocol may need to be maintained for months or even years depending on the severity of the autoimmune condition.</li>
      <li>Use only <strong>pure, unadulterated essential oils</strong> that are distilled in surgical stainless steel with no added chemicals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We exclusively recommend <strong>Young Living Essential Oils</strong> for this protocol due to their Seed to Seal¬Æ purity guarantee and rigorous testing standards.

    <h2>Additional Supportive Measures</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the Raindrop Technique, we strongly encourage a shift toward a <strong>clean, whole-food diet</strong>‚Äîavoiding processed foods, refined sugars, and chemical additives that can inflame the immune system.
